# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/server.ts` is the HTTP entry point that wires middleware and routes.
- `src/routes/` contains external trigger routes (for example, `github.ts`).
- `src/agent/` contains agent orchestration logic (`prompt.ts`, `runAgent.ts`).
- `dist/` is the TypeScript build output (generated by `npm run build`).
- `.env.example` documents required runtime configuration.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm run dev` runs the server with `ts-node-dev` and auto-restarts on change.
- `npm run build` compiles TypeScript to `dist/`.
- `npm start` runs the compiled server from `dist/server.js`.
- `npm run lint` runs ESLint against `src/**/*.ts`.
- `npm test` runs Jest (no custom config present).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- TypeScript is compiled with `strict` mode (see `tsconfig.json`).
- Use 2-space indentation and single quotes to match existing files.
- Favor `camelCase` for functions/variables and `PascalCase` for types/classes.
- Use `camelCase` filenames for new modules (for example, `runAgent.ts`).

## Testing Guidelines
- Jest is the test runner (`npm test`).
- No tests are present yet; add new tests in `src/__tests__/` or as `*.test.ts`.
- No coverage thresholds are defined; document any additions in PRs.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- This folder is not a Git repository, so no commit history is available here.
- If a convention is not defined by your team, consider Conventional Commits
  (for example, `feat: add webhook validation`).
- PRs should include a short summary, test commands run, and any config changes
  (for example, new `ENV` keys or updated webhook secrets).

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in secrets locally; never commit keys.
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is required for agent calls; `DATABASE_URL` is optional.
